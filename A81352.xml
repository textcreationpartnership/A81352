         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SIR, I ſhould have been very glad to have ſeen you this laſt Summer at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe I thought you would have come thither on purpoſe to ſtay there, and that having more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences there then any where elſe to try expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, whereof you have intimated you ſtand in need to finiſh the Treatiſes you promiſed to the world, you would not fail to keep your word
<pb facs="tcp:169809:3"/>with me, and wee ſhould ſhortly ſee them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but you have utterly defeated me of that joy, by your return to <hi>Holland:</hi> and I cannot here refrain from telling you, that I am angry with you, for not letting me (before you took your journey) ſee the Treatiſe of the Paſſions, which, I was told, you had compiled. Beſides, reflecting on ſome words I had read in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſome two years ſince uſhering the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Principles into French, wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you had ſpoken ſuccinctly of the parts of Philoſophy yet to be diſcovered, before the chief fruit thereof can be gathered, and ſaid, that you do not ſo much miſtruſt your own ſtrength, but you dare undertake to make them all known if you had conveniences to try experiments to maintain, and juſtifie your arguments, you adde, greater expences are neceſſary for that purpoſe, than a private man, as you are, is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe unleſs aſſiſted by the publique: but that ſince you could not expect this aſſiſtance, you thought to reſt contented from thence forwards with ſtudying for your own private inſtruction; and that poſterity ſhould excuſe you, if you left off labouring for them: now I am afraid in good earneſt that you will envy the world the reſt of your inventions, and wee never ſhall have any thing elſe of you, if we let you follow your own inclination. This is the reaſon why I bethought me to torment you a little with this Letter, and revenge my ſelf of your refuſall of
<pb facs="tcp:169809:3"/>that Treatiſe of the Paſſions to me, by ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproving you for lazineſſe and other faults, which, I conceive, hinder you from improving your talent, as you may, and your duty binds you. Upon my word, I cannot think it any thing but your lazineſſe, and little care to be ſerviceable to mankind, which cauſeth you not to go forwards with your Phyſicks: for though I very well underſtand, it is impoſſible for you to finiſh them without many experiments, which ought to be defrayed by the publique, becauſe they will reap the profit of it, and a private mans eſtate is not ſufficient to do it; yet I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that is your Remora, for you cannot chooſe but obtain from the diſpencers of the publique treaſure, all you can wiſh to that purpoſe, if you would but vouchſafe to make known to them how the caſe ſtands, as you eaſily might do, had you a will to it; but you have ever lived in a way ſo repugnant thereunto, that there is reaſon to ſuſpect that you would not accept aſſiſtance from any one, though it were offered to you; and yet you pretend, poſterity ſhall excuſe you, if you take pains for it no more, on a ſuppoſition that this aſſiſtance is neceſſary, and you cannot get it; which gives me occaſion to think, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you are too ſparing of your pains, but, it may be, that you have not courage enough to hope to goe through with what they who have read your writings expect of you; and yet you are ſo vainglorious as to perſwade our ſucceſſors,
<pb facs="tcp:169809:4"/>that you failed not of it by any fault of your own, but becauſe your vertue was not encouraged as it ought to have been, and you were denyed furtherance in your deſignes; wherein, I ſee, your ambition hits the mark it aimed at becauſe they who hereafter ſhall view your works, will conceive by what you publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a dozen years agoe, that you then had found out all that ſince hath been ſeen to come from you, and what remains to be inveſtigated in Phyſicks, is leſſe difficult then what you have already made known: ſo that you might ſince have given us all that may be expected from humane reaſon concerning Phyſick, and other neceſſaries of life, if you had had conveniences to make experiments requiſite thereunto: nay, that you have found out a good part of them too, but a juſt indignation againſt the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of man hath diſſwaded you from letting them participate of your inventions; ſo you think that by lying ſtill for ever, you ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as much reputation, as if you took pains for it; and, if may be, more, becauſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good poſſeſſed, is more valued then what is deſired, or lamented. But I'l debar you from getting reputation without deſerving it; and though I doubt not but you knew well enough what you ſhould have done, if you would have been helped by the publique: for indeed, I will cauſe this Letter to be printed, that you may not pretend ignorance of it; that if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb facs="tcp:169809:4"/>you fail to ſatisfie us, you may no more impute it to this age; for know, it is not enough to obtaine any thing from the publike, to have blurted out an occaſionall word of it in the Preface of a book, not abſolutely ſaying that you deſire it, and expect it, nor giving them proofes not only that you deſerve it, but that they ought for their own ſakes to grant it you, in regard they expect great profit by it; It is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeen, that they, who think they have any thing in them, make ſuch a noiſe of it, and ſo importunately demand what they pretend to, and promiſe ſo farre beyond what they can perform, that when a man only ſpeaks modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelf, and requires nought from any man, nor promiſes any thing certainly, what proofe ſoever hee gives otherwiſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, hee is neither lookt nor thought on.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay, it may bee, that it goes againſt your nature to requeſt any thing, or ſpeak advantagiouſly of your ſelf; becauſe, one ſeems a mark of a mean ſpirit, the other of Pride. But, ſay I, this humour is to be corrected, for it proceeds from an errour of weakneſs, rather then a becomming ſhamefacedneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; for, for matter of requeſts, a man hath no reaſon to be aſhamed of any, unleſſe ſuch as hee makes meerly for his own peculiar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to thoſe from whom in juſtice hee ought not to exact any. So far ſhould hee be, from
<pb facs="tcp:169809:5"/>being of thoſe that tend to the publique utilitie and profit of them to whom they are made, that on the contrary hee may extract glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from them, eſpecially when hee hath already beſtowed things on them worth much more than hee would obtain of them; and for ſpeaking advantagiouſly of a mans ſelfe, it is true, it is a moſt ridiculous, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pride, when hee ſpeakes falſe things of himſelfe; and it is even a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible vanity too, when he ſpeaks only truths, meerly out of oſtentation, and ſo that no good accrew to any one thereby; but when theſe things ſo much concern other men to know, it is moſt certain they cannot be concealed, but out of a vicious humility, which is a ſort of baſeneſs, and weakneſs. Now, it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the publique to be advertiſed of what you have gathered in Sciences, that thereby judging what you are able to diſcover in them further, it may be incited to contribute its utmoſt to help you therein, as in a work whoſe end is the generall good of mankind, and the things you have already given, the important truths, you have laid down in your Books, are worth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably much more than any thing you can ask for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo ſay that your works ſpeak enough, and there is no need of adding promiſes and brags, which being the merchandize of jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Mountebanks ſeem not becomming a man
<pb facs="tcp:169809:5"/>of honour, who only ſearcheth after truth: but Mountebanks are not blame-worthy for talking high and well of themſelves, but for ſpeaking untruths, and things they cannot make good; whereas thoſe which (I urge) you ſhould ſpeak of your ſelf, are ſo true, and ſo manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in your writings, that the ſtricteſt rules of modeſty give you leave to aſcertain them, and thoſe of Charity oblige you thereunto, becauſe it concerns others to know it. For although your writings ſay enough to thoſe who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them throughly, and are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; yet that is not ſufficient for the deſigne I would adviſe you to, becauſe every one is not able to read them, and they who manage the publique affaires can ſcarce have any leiſure to doe it. It may be, ſome who have read them, tell them of it: but whatſoever a man ſay to them of it, the little coile, they know, you keep, and the too great modeſty you have ever obſerved in ſpeaking of your ſelf, make them not take any great notice thereof. And indeed becauſe it a uſuall thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to beſtow the higheſt tearms imaginable on the commendation of very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men, they are not apt to receive the immenſe praiſes beſtowed on you by thoſe who know you, for exact truths; whereas when any man ſpeaks of himſelf extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they hearken to him with more attention, eſpecially if hee be a man of good birth,
<pb facs="tcp:169809:6"/>and they know him to bee neither by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor his rank, likely to act the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank; and becauſe hee would become ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous if he ſhould uſe hyperbolies on ſuch an occaſion, his words are taken in their true ſence: and they who will not believe them are incited at leaſt by their curioſity, or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, to examine the truth of them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being moſt certain, and the publique being much concerned in knowing that no man in the world but your ſelfe (at leaſt whoſe writings wee have) ever diſcovered the true principles, and underſtood the firſt cauſes of whatever is produced in nature; and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already given an account by theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, of all thoſe things which are moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and frequently obſerved in the world, you need only ſome particular obſervations to find out, in like manner, the reaſons of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be uſefull to man in this life, and ſo give us a compleat knowledge of the nature of all mineralls, the vertues of all Plants, the properties of animals, and generally all that may be beneficiall to Phyſick, or other arts. And laſtly, that theſe particular obſervations not being poſſible to bee all made in a ſmall time without great expence, all people of the earth ought emulouſly to contribute thereunto, as to the moſt important thing in the world, wherein they have all an equall intereſt. This being, I ſay, moſt certain, to bee ſufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:169809:6"/>proved by your works already printed, you ſhould talk ſo lowd of it, publiſh it with ſo much care, and put it ſo punctually in all the Title-pages of your Books, that none hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might pretend ignorance. So at leaſt, you would immediately beget a longing in many to examine what the matter is: ſo that the further they enquired into it, and the more diligently they read your Books, they would the more clearly underſtand, you not unjuſtly boaſted.</p>
                  <p>And I would wiſh you chiefly to clear three things to the world. Firſt, that there are a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company of things to be found out in Phyſicks, that may bee extreamly profitable for life: Secondly, that there is great reaſon to expect the finding them out from you: And thirdly, that the more conveniences you had to make experiments, the more of them you could find out; It is neceſſary to be informed of the firſt becauſe moſt men think there can nothing be found out in the Sciences, better then what hath been found by the Ancients; and ſome conceive not ſo much as what the meaning of Phyſicks is, or what they are good for. Now it is eaſie to prove that the too great reverence born to antiquity, is an errour extreamly prejudicial to the advancement of Sciences. For it is ſeen that the ſavage people of <hi>America,</hi> and many others who inhabite places leſſe remote, have many leſſe conveniences of life then wee, and yet their originall is as ancient as ours, ſo that they have
<pb facs="tcp:169809:7"/>as much reaſon as wee to ſay that they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the wiſdome of their fathers, and that they believe no man can teach them better than what hath been known and practized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them from all Antiquity. And this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſo prejudiciall, that till it be rejected, it is impoſſible any new learning can be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: beſides, experience ſhewes, that the people whoſe mind it is deepeſt rooted in, are they who are yet moſt ignorant, and leaſt civilized; and becauſe it is frequent enough yet amongſt us, that may be one reaſon to prove, that wee are farre from knowing all wee are capable of; Which may be proved by many exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitable inventions, as the uſe of the Compaſſe, the Art of Printing Perſpective glaſſes, and the like, which were not found out till theſe latter ages, although now they ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to thoſe that know them. But there is nothing, wherein our neceſſity of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring new knowledge is more apparent than in Phyſick: For although no man doubts that God hath furniſhed this earth with all things neceſſary for man, to conſerve him therein in perfect health untill an extreame old age; and although there be nothing in the world ſo deſired as theſe things, ſo that heretofore it hath bin the ſtudy of Kings and Sages; yet experience ſhews, wee are ſo far from having it wholly, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a man is chained to his bed by ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, which the moſt learned Phyſicians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:169809:7"/>not, and onely make them rage more by their remedies, when they undertake to expell them. Wherein the defect of their art, and the neceſſity of perſecting it, is ſo evident, that for thoſe who underſtand not what the meaning of Phyſicks is, it is enough to tell them, that it is the Science which ſhould teach ſo perfectly to underſtand the nature of man, and all things that may ſerve him for nutriments or remedies, that it might be eaſie for him, thereby to exempt himſelfe from all kinds of diſeaſes: for not to ſpeake of any other uſes thereof, this alone is weighty enough, to oblige the moſt inſenſible to favour the deſignes of a man, who hath already proved by the things he hath already found out, that there is great reaſon to expect from him the unfound remainder of that Science.</p>
                  <p>But there is an extraordinary neceſſity that the world ſhould know, you have proved that your ſelfe: and to this end it is requiſite you uſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle violence to your own nature, and baniſh that too great modeſty, which hath hitherto hindered you from ſpeaking what you are bound to doe, both of your ſelfe and others. Yet I meane not not therefore to commit you to the learned of this age; the moſt part of thoſe, on whom this name is conferred, to wit, thoſe who cultivate (as they commonly call it) good literature, and the Lawyers have not any thing to doe in what I would have have you talk off. Divines and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have as little too, unleſſe in the notion of
<pb facs="tcp:169809:8"/>Philoſophers: for Divinity depends not a jot on Phyſickes, nor yet Phyſick as at this day it is practiſed by the moſt learned and prudent in that Art: they are contented to follow the maximes and rules that a long experience hath taught them, and doe not ſo much contemne the lives of men, as to leave their judgement, whereon it often depends, on the uncertain ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations of Schoole-Philoſophy: none then but the Philoſophers are unſatisfied, among whom all who have wit are on your ſide, and would rejoyce to ſee you manumit truth, ſo that the malignity of Pedants might not be able to oppreſſe her: for none but meere Pedants can be angry at what you have to ſay: and in regard they are the laughing-ſtock and contempt of moſt wel-bred men, you need not ſtand much on their diſpleaſure: beſides, your reputation hath made them already as much your enemies as they can be: and whereas your modeſty now cauſeth ſome of them not to fear to ſet upon you, I am confident, would you but extoll your ſelfe as you might, and ought, they would ſee themſelves ſo far beneath you, that there is not one of them but would be aſhamed to undertake you. I ſee no reaſon, then that may detaine you from boldly publiſhing, whatſoever you may judge ſerviceable to your deſigne: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemes to me better for it then what you have already written in a letter to the reverend Father <hi>Dinet,</hi> which you cauſed to be printed
<pb facs="tcp:169809:8"/>ſeven yeers ſince, when he was Provinciall of the Jeſuites of France. <hi>Non ibi,</hi> ſay you ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eſſayes you had publiſhed five or ſixe yeers before, <hi>unam aut alteram, ſed plus ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis quaeſtionibus, quae ſic à nullo ante me fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant explicatae; ac quamvis multi hactenus mea ſcripta tranſver ſis ocul is inſpexerint, modiſque omnibus refutare conati ſunt, nemo tamen, quod ſciam, quicquam non verum potuit in iis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perire: fiat enumeratiò quaeſtionum omnium, quae in tot ſaeculis, quibus aliae Philoſophiae viguerunt, ipſarum ope ſolutae ſunt, et fortè nec tam multae, nec tam illuſtres invenientur: quinimò profiteor ne unius quidem quaeſtionis ſolutionem, ope prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiorum Peripatetice Philoſphiae peculiarium, datam unquam fuiſſe, quam non poſſum demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrare eſſe illegitimam, et falſam: fiat periculum; proponantur, non quidem omnes (neque enim openae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretium puto multum temporis in eâ re impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere) ſed paucae aliquae ſelectiores, ſtabo promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, &amp;c.</hi> Thus in ſpight of all your modeſty, the force of truth hath compelled you there, to write that you had ſtated in your firſt Eſſayes, which containe nought almoſt but the Diopticks and the meteors, above 600 queſtions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which none before you knew how to do, and that although many lookt aſquint upon your writings, and ſought all manner of wayes to confute them, yet you knew not hitherto any who had pickt any untruth out of them: whereto you ſubjoyn, that if all the queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb facs="tcp:169809:9"/>by all other kinds of Philoſophying, which have been in vogue ſince the world began were reckoned up one by one, they would not, it may be, be found ſo numerous, nor ſo eminent. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, you aſſure us, that by thoſe principles, peculiar to the Philoſphy attributed to Ariſtotle, which onely is now taught in the Schooles, no man ever yet knew how to find out the true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of any one queſtion; and you abſolutely defie all thoſe who teach it to name any one plainly reſolved by them, in the ſolution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you can not demonſtrate ſome errour: now, theſe things having been written to a Provinciall of the Jeſuites, and publiſhed above ſeven yeers ſince, there is no doubt but ſome of the ableſt of that great ſociety, would have endeavoured to confute them, had not they been perfectly true, or if they could have been but ſo much as diſputed with any colour of reaſon: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the little noiſe you make, all men know your reputation is already ſo great, &amp; they are ſo much intereſſed to maintain, that what they teach is not bad, they can not pretend to ſay they ſlighted it: but all the learned know well enough, that there is nothing in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickes of the School, but what is dubious; and they know withall, that to be dubious in ſuch a matter, is not much better than to be falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſcience ought to be certaine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative: ſo that they cannot thinke ſtrange, that you aſſure them their Phyſickes containe not
<pb facs="tcp:169809:9"/>the true ſolution of any one queſtion; for that ſignifies no more, but that it containes not the demonſtration of any unknown truth; and if any one examines your writings to confute them, he finds on the other ſide, that they containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but demonſtrations, concerning matters formerly unknown to all the world: wherefore being wiſe and adviſed, I wonder not that they hold their peace, but I marvell why you have not vouchſafed to take advantage of their ſilence, becauſe you could not have wiſhed any thing more to make it apparent how much difference there is betwixt your Phyſickes and others. And it is very important to obſerve the difference of them, that the ill opinion of thoſe who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſtate, and are moſt ſucceſſefull uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have of Philoſophy, hinder them not from underſtanding the worth of yours: for they commonly conjecture what ſhall befall, by what they have already ſeen to happen; and becauſe they never ſaw the publike reape any benefit by School Philoſophy unleſſe that it hath made many Pedants, they cannot imagine better is to be expected from yours, unleſſe they are brought to conſider that this being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, and that utterly falſe, their fruits muſt be different. In earneſt, it is a ſtrong argument to prove there is no truth in School Phyſickes, but to ſay it is inſtituted to teach all inventions profitable for life, and nevertheleſſe, though there have many been found out from time to time, yet it never was by the meanes of any of
<pb facs="tcp:169809:10"/>theſe Phyſickes, but only by chance, or cuſtom: or if any Science have contributed thereunto, it hath been only the Mathematicks: which alone of all humane Sciences hath been able to prove ſome indubitable truthes. I know well enough, the Philoſophers admit that for one branch of their Phyſickes; but in regard they were almoſt all of them ignorant in it, and it was no part of it, but on the other ſide true Phyſickes were a part of the Mathematicks, this can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them: but the certainty already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Mathematicks makes much for you: for it is a Science wherein you are acknowledged to be ſo excellent, and you have therein ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped envy, that even thoſe who are jealous of your eſtimation for other Sciences, uſe to ſay you ſurpaſſe all men in this, that by granting a commendation which they knew cannot be diſputed, they may be leſſe ſuſpected of calumny when they endeavour to rob you of others: and it is ſeen by what you have publiſhed concerning Geometry, that you there ſo determine how far humane capacity can reach, and which is the way of ſolving every manner of ſcruple, that it ſeemes you have reached the whole harveſt, whereof thſe who write before you have onely cropped ſome ears: and your ſucceſſours can be but gleaners, who ſhall gather up onely thoſe you were pleaſed to leave them: beſides, you have ſhewn, by the ſudden and eaſie ſolution of all queſtions, which thoſe who have tried you
<pb facs="tcp:169809:10"/>have propounded to you, that the Method you uſe for this purpoſe is ſo infallible that you never fail to find thereby, what ever the wit of man can, belonging to the things you ſeek after: ſo that to make it undoubted that you are able to bring Phyſicks to the lighteſt perfection, you are onely to prove, them to be a part of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and you have already proved it plainly enough in your principles: when explaining all ſenſible Qualities, conſidering onely their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, figures, and motions, you ſhewed that the viſible world, which is all the object of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, containes only a ſmall part of the infinite bodies whereof the proprieties or Qualities may be imagined, conſiſts onely of theſe very things whereas the object of the Mathematickes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all; the ſame may alſo be proved by the experience of all ages: for although from time to time many of the beſt wits, have beſtowed their time in the inveſtigation of Phyſick, as it can not be ſaid that any of them ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ought (that is, attained any true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the nature of corporeall things) by any principle, that belonged not to the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: whereas, by thoſe belonging to them, abundance of very uſefull things have been found out, to wit, almoſt all that is known of Aſtronomy, Chirurgery, and all Mechanicall arts: wherein, if there be any thing more then what belongs to this ſcience, it is not drawne from any other, but onely from certain obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb facs="tcp:169809:11"/>whoſe true cauſes are unknown; which cannot be conſidered ſeriouſly, but it muſt be confeſſed, that the knowledge of true Phyſicks is to be attained no way but by the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes; and your excellence in this not being doubted, there is nothing but may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from you in that; yet there remaines one ſcruple, for that it is ſeen that all who have acquired ſome reputation in the Mathematicks, are not, for all that, capable to find out any thing in Phyſicks, nay, and ſome of them leſſe comprehend the things you have written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than many who never learnt any Science at all: but it may be anſwered, that although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they who have wits apteſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truths of the Mathematicks, are they who eaſieſt underſtand your Phyſicks, by reaſon all the arguments of theſe are deducted from the other; it happens not alwayes that theſe men have the greateſt reputation for the moſt learned in the Mathematicks; becauſe to acquire this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation it is neceſſary to ſtudy the bookes of thoſe who heretofore have written of this Science, which the moſt doe not, and oftentimes, thoſe who doe, endeavouring to attaine by labour what they cannot by the ſtrength of their wit, tire out their imagination, yea, hurt it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thereby many prejudices, which hinder them much more from conceiving the truths you write, than paſſing f or great Marhemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: becauſe ſo few men apply themſelves to
<pb facs="tcp:169809:11"/>this Science, that of times there is but one of them in a whole Country; and though ſometimes there be more, they keep a great ſtir with it, in regard the little they underſtand hath coſt them a great deal of pains. Now, it is not uneaſie to apprehend the truths another man hath diſcovered: it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for that, that the brain be diſengaged of all ſorts of prejudices, and be willing to afford atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them; nor is it difficult to find ſome of a contrary bias to the reſt, as heretofore <hi>Thales, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> and <hi>Achimedes,</hi> and in our age <hi>Gilbert, Kepler, Galileo, Harvey,</hi> and ſome others. Laſtly, a man may, without much pains, imagine a body of Philoſophy, leſſe monſtrous, and grounded on conjectures more conformable to truth, than that which is extracted from the writings of Ariſtotle, which hath been done too by ſome in this age: but to frame one that containes only truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by demonſtrations as clear and certaine as thoſe of the Mathematicks, there is none but you alone who have ſhewed us by your writings that you could compaſſe it. But as when an Architect hath laid all the foundations, &amp; erected the chief walls of ſome vaſt building, none doubts that he is able to finiſh his deſigne, becauſe it is ſeen that he hath already done the hardeſt part of it: ſo thoſe who attentively have read your book of Principles, conſidering how you have there laid all the foundations of naturall Philoſophy, and how great are the conſequences of truths which you have therein exhibited, cannot doubt, that the
<pb facs="tcp:169809:12"/>Method you uſe is ſufficient, whereby you may make an end of finding out the utmoſt that can be diſcovered in Phyſicks: becauſe the things which you have already made known to wit the nature of the loadſtone, fire, aire, water earth, and all that appeares in the heavens, ſeem not to be leſſe difficult then thoſe which may be deſire.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt adde here, that let an Architect be never ſo expert in his art it is impoſſible hee ſhould finiſh the edifice hee hath begun if mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials requiſite are deficient: in like manner let your method be never ſo exact, yet you cannot make any further progreſſe in the explication of naturall cauſes, unleſs you be able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite experiments to determine their effects; which is the laſt of the three things, I believe, ought chiefly to be explained, becauſe moſt men conceive not how neceſſary experiments are, nor what expence they require; thoſe who, not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of their ſtudy, nor caſting their eyes on any thing but their books, undertake to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of nature, may well tell how they would have created the world, had God given them authority, and power to do it; that is, they might deſcribe Chimera's that have as much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy with the imbecilitie of their wit, as the admirable beauty of this Univerſe, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puiſſance of its Maker: but without a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit truly divine, they cannot of themſelves, frame an Idea, of things, like that which God had to create them. And though your Method promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:169809:12"/>all that may be hoped for from humane wit, concerning the enquiry after truth in the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it doth not promiſe to teach Prophecie; but to deduce from certain things laid down, all truths that may from thence be deducted: and the things laid down in Phyſicks can be nothing but experiments. Moreover becauſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of two ſorts; ſome eaſie, that depend only on the reflexion a man makes on things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the ſenſes of themſelves; others, more rare and difficult, which are not attained without ſome ſtudy, and expence: it may bee obſerved, that you have already inſerted in your writings all that ſeems may be gahtered out of eaſie experiments, and alſo the rareſt too, that you could learn out of books, For beſides your explaining the nature of all qualities that move the ſenſes, and the moſt ordinary bodies on the earth, as fire, air, water, and ſome others in them, you have alſo therein given an account of all that hath been obſerved hitherto in the heavens, of all the properties of the Loadſtone, and many Chymicall obſervations; So that there is no reaſon to expect any more from you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Phyſicks, till you have made more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, whereof you might enquire the cauſes; And I wonder not, that you undertake not to try theſe experiments at your own charges; For, I know, the enquirie after the ſmalleſt things coſt a great deal: and not to quote Chymiſts, nor the reſt of the hunters after ſecrets, who uſe
<pb facs="tcp:169809:13"/>to undoe themſelves at that trade, I heard ſay that the Loadſtone only coſt <hi>Gilbert</hi> above 50000 crowns, though he were a man of very great parts, as he hath ſhewed by being the firſt who diſcovered the chief properties of that ſtone. I have alſo ſeen the Advancement to Learning, and the <hi>New Atlantis,</hi> of my Lord Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> who, of all them that have written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, ſeems to me the man who had the beſt notions, concerning the method to be held to bring the Phyſicks to their perfection; but the whole Revenue of two or three of the richeſt Kings on the earth, would not be enough to ſet all things he requires for this purpoſe on work. And although I think you doe not need ſo many ſorts of experiments as hee imagines becauſe you may ſupply many, as well by your dexterity, as the knowledge of truths you have already found: yet conſidering that the number of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bodies unexamined, is almoſt infinite that there is not any one but hath a great many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall properties and whereof ſeverall tryals may be made, to take up the time, and labour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men; that according to the rules of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it is neceſſary at once to examine all things who have any affinitie between them, the better to marke their differences, and to make ſuch quantities as you may be aſſured, that ſo you may profitably make uſe at the ſame time of more ſeverall experiments, than the labour of a great many able men could furniſh you withall,
<pb facs="tcp:169809:13"/>and laſtly, that you cannot get theſe able men but at a great rate, becauſe if ſome would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves gratis, they would not be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough to your orders, and would only give you occaſion to loſe time: conſidering, I ſay, all theſe things, I eaſily comprehend, you cannot handſomly finiſh the deſigne you have begun in your principles, that is, particularly to lay open the nature of all Minerals, Plants, animals and man, as you have already done all the elements of the earth, and all obſervable in the heavens, unleſſe the publique defray the expences neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for that purpoſe; and the more liberall they ſhall be to you, the better you ſhall be able to goe through with your deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe all theſe things may be eaſily comprehended by every one, and are all ſo true, they cannot be doubted, I am confident, that if you repreſented them in ſuch a manner, as they might come to the knowledge of thoſe, to whom God hath given power to command the people of the earth, and charge alſo to doe their utmoſt to advance the common good, there is none of them but would contribute to a deſigne ſo manifeſtly profitable to the whole world; and though out <hi>France,</hi> which is your Country, be ſo mighty a State, that you might eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from her alone whatſoever is requiſite to this purpoſe, yet becauſe other Nations are no leſs intereſſed therein than ſhee, I am confident many would be generous enough not to give her
<pb facs="tcp:169809:14"/>place in that duty: and that there would not any bee ſo barbarous as not to put in a hand.</p>
                  <p>But if all that I have written be not enough to make you of another humour, pray, at leaſt oblige me ſo farre as to ſend me your Treatiſe of the Paſſions, and give me leave to adde a Preface to it, wherewith it may be printed. I will ſee, it ſhall be ſo done, that there ſhall be nothing you can diſlike in it but it ſhall be ſo conformable to the reſentment of all thoſe who have either wit or vertue, that no man after hee hath read it, but ſhall participate in the zeale I have to the advancement of Sciences, and to be, &amp;c.</p>

Wherfore I will not here inſiſt in anſwering every particular, I will onely tell you two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that, me thinkes, might deterre you

That I did not formerly beſtow what I had written of the Paſſions on you, was becauſe I would not be engaged to let ſome others ſee it who would have made no uſe of it: for ſince I compiled it to be read onely by a Princeſſe, whoſe wit is ſo far above the common pitch, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives without difficulty what ſeemes hardeſt to our Doctours; I onely purpoſed to unfold what therein was new.

                  <p>TO make this more intelligible, I will in few words diſplay the pieces and lineaments, whereof this Machine our body is compoſed. There is none that doth not already know there is within us, a heart, a braine, a ſtomach, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſinews, arteries, veins, and the like; it is as commonly known, that meats eaten deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomack, and bowells, from whence the juice of them trickling into the liver, and all the veines, mixes it ſelf with the blood in them, and by this means augments the quantity thereof. Thoſe who have heard talk never ſo little of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, know beſides this, how the Heart is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and how all the blood of the veines may with facility drop into the hollow vein, on the right ſide of it, and from thence paſſe into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169809:19"/>Liver, by a veſſell called the venous arterie, then return from the liver into the left ſide of the heart, through the Pipe, called the arterious vein, and at length paſſe from thence into the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, the branches whereof ſpread themſelves all over the body. Yea even all thoſe whom the authority of the Ancients hath not totally blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who have vouchſafed to open their eyes to examine the opinion of <hi>Harvy,</hi> concerning the circulation of the blood, make no doubt but all the veins and arteries of the body are like chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, through which the blood continually and eaſily glides, taking its courſe from the right ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the heart, through the arterious veine, whereof the branches are diſperſed into every part of the Liver, and joyned to thoſe of the venous arterie by which it paſſeth from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the left fide of the heart, from thence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the great arterie, the branches whereof being ſcattered over all the reſt of the body are joyned to the branches of the hollow vein which cary the ſame blood again into the right cavity of the heart: ſo that the two cavities are as it were the ſluces of it, through each of which all the blood paſſes, every round it walks about the body. Moreover it is notorious that all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the members depend upon the muſcles, and that theſe Muſcles are oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch a manner, that when one of them ſhrinks up, it drawes after it that part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereto it is knit, which cauſes the muſcle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169809:19"/>oppoſite to it to ſtretch forth at the ſame time: then again if at another time this laſt ſhrink up, the firſt gives way, ſuffering the other to attract that part it is joyned unto. In fine, it is knowne that all theſe motions of the muſcles, as alſo all the ſenſes depend on the ſinews, which are as little ſtrings, or like ſmall tonnells coming all from the braine, and containing as that does a certain aire, or exceeding ſubtle wind, which is tearmed the Animall ſpirits.</p>

                  <p>THe f irſt effect of it is, that it dilates the blood wherewith the cavities of the heart are fill'd: which is the reaſon that this blood having need
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169809:20"/>of a larger room, paſſes impetuouſly from the right cavity into the arterious vein, and from the left into the great arterie; then, this dilatation ceaſing, immediately new blood from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vein enters into the right cavity of the heart, and from the veinous arterie into the left ;for there are little skins at the entrance of theſe foure veſſells ſo contrived, that they will not let the blood get into the heart, but by the two laſt, nor come out, but by the other two. The new blood being gotten into the heart is there imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rarified as the former was. Hence onely is that pulſe or palpitation of the heart and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for this beating is reiterated as often as any new blood gets into the heart. It is alſo this alone which gives motion to the blood, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it unceſſantly to run very ſwiftly in all the arteries and veines; by means whereof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes the heart acquired in the heart, to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the body, and is their nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>BUt what here is moſt conſiderable is, that all the moſt lively, and ſubtle parts of the blood, that heat hath rarified in the heart, continually enter in abundandance into the cavities of the braine, and the reaſon why they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169809:20"/>go thither rather than any where elſe, is, becauſe all the blood that iſſues out of the heart by the great artery bends its courſe in a direct line thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ward, and it not being poſſible for all to get in, becauſe there are none but very narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, thoſe parts thereof that are the moſt agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and ſubtleſt, only get in, while the reſt is diſperſed into all the other parts of the body. Now theſe very ſubtle parts of the blood make the animall ſpirits; and they need not, to this end, undergoe any other change in the brain, but only be ſeparated from the other leſſe ſubtle parts of the blood; for what I here call ſpirits, are but bodyes, and have no other property, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe tha they are bodies exceeding ſmall, which move very nimbly, as the parts of a flame iſſuing from a torch: ſo that they ſtay not in any one place, but ſtill as ſome get into the cavities of the brain, ſome others get out through the pores in the ſubſtance of it; which pores convey them into the nerves, and from thence into the muſcles, by means whereof they mould the body into all the ſeverall poſtures it can move.</p>

                  <p>FOR the only cauſe of the motion of all the members is, that ſome Muſcles ſhrink up, and their oppoſites extend, as hath been already ſaid; and the only cauſe why one muſcle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169809:21"/>ſhrinkes rather than his oppoſite, is, that there come (though never ſo little) more ſpirits to the one than the other; not that the ſpirits which flow immediatly from the brain, are alone ſufficient to move theſe Muſcles, but they diſpoſe the other ſpirits, which already are in theſe two Muſcles of ſally forth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from one of them into the other: by means whereof that from whence they came becomes longer, and flaggier; that wherein they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly ſwelled up by them, ſhortens and attracts the member appendent to it; which is eaſily conceived, when it is known that there are but very few animal ſpirits which proceed continually from the brain to every Muſcle, but that there are abundance of others lockt in the ſame Muſcle, which move very ſwiftly in it, ſometimes in whirling round only in the places where they are (this is, when they find no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages open to get out at) and ſometimes by ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the oppoſite Muſcle: For there are little overtures in each of theſe Muſcles through which heſe ſpirits can ſlide from one to another, which are ſo diſpoſed too, that when the ſpirits which come from the brain towards one of them, are but never ſo little ſtronger than thoſe going to theother, they open all the entries through which the ſpirits of the other Muſcle can fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, and in the ſame inſtant bar up all thoſe, through which the ſpirits of this might get into that; whereby all the ſpirits formerly contained
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169809:21"/>in both Muſcles crowd ſuddenly into one, ſo ſwelling it up, and ſhortning it, while the other extends it ſelf, and gives.</p>

                  <p>IT remains yet to know the cauſes why the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſlide not from the brain into the Muſcles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways after one manner, and wherefore they come ſometimes more towards ſome than others; For beſides the action of the Soul, which in truth, is in us one of the cauſes, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, there are yet two beſides, which depend not of any thing but the body, which it is neceſſary to take notice of the firſt conſiſts in the diverſitie of motions, excited in the organs of the ſenſes by their objects, which I have already amply enough explained in the Dioptricks: but that thoſe who ſee this, may not need to have read ought elſe, I will here repeat, that there are three things to be conſidered in the ſinews; to wit, their marrow or interiour ſubſtance which ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it ſelf out in the form of little threds from the brain the originall thereof, to the extremities of the other members whereunto theſe threds are faſtened; next, the skins wherein they are lapt, which being continuous with thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velope the brain, make up litle pipes wherein theſe threds are encloſed; laſtly, the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169809:22"/>which being conveyed through theſe very pipes from the brain to the muſcles, are the cauſe that theſe thredds remain there entirely unmole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and extended in ſuch a manner, that the leaſt thing that moves that part of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the extremity of any one of them is faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, doth by the ſame reaſon move that part of the brain from whence it comes: juſt as when a man pulls at one end of a ſtring, he cauſeth the other end to ſtirre.</p>

                  <p>AND I have made it evident in the Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, how all the objects of the ſight are not communicated to us any way but thus; they move locally, (by mediation of tranſparent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies between them and us) thoſe little thredds of the Optick nerves, which are at the bottome of our eyes, and after them, the places of the brain from whence thoſe nerves come: they move them, I ſay, as many ſeverall kinds of wayes, as there are diverſities of objects in things; nor are they immediatly the motions made in the eye, but in the brain, that repreſent theſe objects to the Soul: in imitation whereof it is eaſie to conceive that ſounds, odours, heat, pain, hunger, thirſt, and generally and objects, as well of our other exteriour ſenſes, as our interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169809:22"/>appetites, doe alſo excite ſome motion in our nerves, which paſſes by means of them unto the brain; and beſides, that theſe ſeverall motions of the brain create in our ſoul different reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it may ſo be that that without her, the ſpirits direct their courſe rather towards ſome Muſcles than others, and ſo they may move our members; which I will prove here, only by one example. If any one lift up his hand on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den towards our eyes, as if he were about to ſtrike, although we know he is our friend, that he does this only in jeſt, and that he will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough not to doe us any hurt, yet wee can ſcarce refrain from ſhutting them: which ſhews it is not by the intermedling of our ſoul that they ſhut, ſince it is againſt our will, which is the only, or at leaſt the principall Action thereof; but by reaſon this machine of our body is ſo compoſed, that the moving of this hand up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our eyes, excites another motion in our brain which conveys the animal ſpirits into thoſe muſcles that cloſe the eye-lids.</p>

                  <p>ANd this inequality may proceed from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers matters whereof they are compoſed, as is ſeen in thoſe, who have drunk much wine. The vapours of this wine entering ſuddenly into the blood, mount up from the hear to the brain, where they convert into ſpirits, which being ſtronger, and more abundant than ordinary, are apt to move the body after many ſtrange faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This inequality of the ſpirits may alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the divers diſpoſitions of the heart, liver, Stomacke, ſpleene, and all other parts contributing to their production. For it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally neceſſary here to obſerve certaine little nerves inſerted in the baſis of the heart, which ſerve to lengthen, and contract the entries of its concavities: by meanes whereof, the blood there dilating more, or leſſe ſtrongly, produces ſpirits diverſly diſpoſed. It is alſo to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the blood which enters into the heart, comes thither from all the other parts of the body, yet it falls out often times that more is driven thither from ſome parts than others, by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169809:23"/>reaſon the nerves or muſcles which anſwer to thoſe parts oppreſſe or agitate it more; and for that according to the diverſity of the parts from whence it comes moſt, it dilates it ſelfe diverfly in the heart, and at laſt produces ſpirits of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures, as for example, that which comes from the lower part of the liver, where the gall is, dilates it ſelfe otherwiſe in the heart, than that which comes from the ſpleene; and this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner than that which comes from the veines of the leggs, or armes and laſtly, this quite otherwiſe than the juyce of meats, when being newly come out of the ſtomack, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, it paſſes through the liver to the heart.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, it is to be obſerved, that the machine of our body is ſo compoſed, that all the changes befalling the motion of the ſpirits may ſo worke as to open ſome pores of the braine more than others: and reciprocally, that when any one of theſe pores are never ſo little more or leſſe open than uſuall by the Action of thoſe nerves ſubſervient to the ſenſes, it changes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the motion of the ſpirits, and cauſes them to be conveyed into the muſcles which ſerve to move the body in that manner it ordinarily
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169809:24"/>is, upon occaſion of ſuch an Action. So that all the motions we make, our will not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to them (as it often happens that we ſigh, walk, eat, and to be ſhort, doe all actions common to us, and beaſts) depend onely on the conformity of our members, and the ſtreame which the ſpirits, excited by the heat of the heart, follow naturally into the braine nerves, and muſcles.

                  <p>HAving thus conſidered all the functions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the body only, it is eaſie to know, there remaines nothing in us, which we ought to attribute to our Soul, unleſſe our thoughts, which are chiefly of two kinds, to wit, ſome, Actions of the Soul, others, her Paſſions.

                  <p>Again our Wills are of two ſorts. For ſome are actions of the Soul which terminate in the Soul it ſelfe, as when we will love God, or generally apply our thought to any object which is not materiall. The other are actions which terminate in our body, as in this caſe, that we have onely a will to walke, it followes that our legges muſt ſtir and we goe.</p>

                  <p>Among the apprehenſions cauſed by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the greateſt part depend on the nerves.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169809:25"/>take their courſe at haphazzard through ſome certaine pores, rather than others.

                  <p>IT is here to be obſerved that all the ſame things which the Soul perceives by intercourſe with the nerves, may alſo be repreſented to it by the accidentall courſe of the ſpirits; and no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them but this, that the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which come from the brain by the nerves, are uſually more lively, and manifeſt than thoſe the ſpirits excite there, which made me ſay in the one and twentieth Article, that theſe are onely as the ſhadow, and repreſentation of thoſe.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169809:31"/>and part into thoſe which (as is ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) let out or draw upon together the orifices of the heart, or which elſe ſo agitate the reſt of the parts from whence the blood is ſent, that this blood not being rarified there in the uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſends ſpirits to the braine that are fitting to maintain, and confirm the paſſion of fear, that is, ſuch as are proper to hold open, or open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the pores of the brain that convey them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very ſame nerves; for the meere entry of theſe ſpirits into theſe pores excites in this kernell a particular motion, inſtituted by nature to make the ſoul feel that paſſion; and becauſe theſe pores relate principally to the little nerves that ſerve to lock up or open wide the orifices of the heart, this makes the ſoul feel it, as if it were chiefly in the heart.</p>

And all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul conſiſts in this, that ſhe meerely by willing any thing can make the little kernell, whereunto ſhe is ſtrictly joyned, move in the manner requiſite to produce the effect relating to this Will.</p>

For theſe traces are nothing elſe but the pores of the braine, through which the ſpirits formerly took their courſe, by reaſon of the preſence of that object, have thereby accquired a greater facility to be open in the ſame manner again than the reſt can have, by the ſpirits that come to them: ſo that theſe ſpirits meeting theſe pores, enter into them eaſier than the others: whereby, they excite a peculiar motion in the kernell, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents

So, when one would fix his attention ſome pretty while to conſider, or ruminate on one object, this Will holds the kernell ſtill at that time, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever to one ſide.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169809:34"/>look on an object farr diſtant, this Will cauſes the ball of them to dilate themſelves: and if one would prompt them to behold an object very neer, this Will contracts them; but if one thinks onely to dilate the ball, he had as good doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: that dilates it not at all: becauſe nature hath not joyned the motion of the kernell, which ſerves to drive the ſpirits to the optick nerve in that manner as is requiſite to dilate or contract the ball of the eye, with the will of dilating or contracting it, but with the will of looking on objects remote, or at hand; and then when we ſpeak, we only think the ſenſe of what we would ſay, yet that makes us move our tongues and lips, much better, and farre readier than if wee thought to move them in all the manners requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to pronounce the ſame words. Foraſmuch as the habit we have acquired in learning to ſpeak, hath taught us to joyn the action of the Soul, which by the intercourſe of the kernell can move the tongue, and the lipps, with the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words which follow out of theſe motions, rather than with the motions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <p>NOw, there is a peculiar reaſon why the Soul cannot ſuddenly alter or ſtop her Paſſions: which gave me occaſion to put formerly in their definition, that they are not only cauſed, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and fortified by ſome peculiar motion of the ſpirits; the reaſon is, they are almoſt all coupled with ſome emotion made in the heart, and conſequently in all the blood, and ſpirits too, ſo that till this emotion ceaſe, they remain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in our thoughts, juſt as ſenſible objects are preſent in them, while they act againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of our ſenſes; and as the Soul being very sattentive on any other thing, may chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewill hear a little noiſe, or feel a little pain or no, but cannot keep her ſelf from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169809:35"/>thunder, or feeling fire that burns the hand: ſo ſhee may eaſily overcome the ſmaller Paſſions, but not the violenteſt, and ſtrongeſt, untill after the emotion of the blood and ſpirits is allayed. The moſt the Will can doe, while this emotion is in its full ſtrength, is not to conſent to its effects; and to reſtrain divers motions whereunto it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the body. For example; if wrath makes me lift up my hand to ſtrike, the Will can uſually reſtrain it: if fear incites my legs to fly, the Will can ſtop them: and ſo of the reſt.</p>

                  <p>ANd it is only in the repugnance of thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the body by its ſpirits, and the Soul by her Wil, endeavour to excite at the ſame time in the kernall, that all the conteſtations which uſe to be imagined between the inferiour part of the Soul, called ſenſitive, and the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our which is reaſonable, or elſe between the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall appetites, and the Will, conſiſt; for there is in us but one Soul only and this Soul hath no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of parts in it; the ſame which is ſenſible is rationall, and all her appetites are her Wills. The errour committed in making her act two ſeverall parts, which are uſually contrary one to another, proceeds meerly hence, that her functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169809:35"/>have not been diſtinguiſhed from them of the body, to which only all that can be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in us repugnant to our reaſon ought to bee attributed; ſo that there is here no other conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, unleſſe that the little kernell in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the brain, being driven on one ſide by the ſoul, and on the other by the animall ſpirits (which are only bodies, as I laid down before) it happens oftentimes that theſe two impulſions are contrary, and that the ſtrongeſt hinders the operation of the other. Now we may diſtiguiſh two ſorts of motions, excited by the ſpirits in the kernell: ſome repreſent to the ſoul the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which move the ſenſes, or the impreſſions found in the brain, which uſe not any violence on the Will; others doe uſe violence, to wit, ſuch as cauſe the Paſſions, or motions of the body concomitant with them. And for the firſt though they often-times hinder the action of the ſoul, or elſe be hindered by it, yet by reaſon that they are not directly contrary, there is not any conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation obſerved in them; it is only taken notice of among the laſt, and the Wills which reſiſt them: for example; between that violence wherewith the ſpirits drive the kernell to cauſe in the ſoul a deſire of any thing, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Soul beats it back by the will ſhe hath to avoid the ſame thing and what chiefly makes this conteſtation appear, is that the Will having not the power to excite the Paſſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly (as hath been already ſaid) is conſtrained
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169809:36"/>to uſe art and fall on conſidering ſucceſſively di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, if but one wherof chance to be ſtrong enough to alter the courſe of the ſpirits one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is poſſible, that which follows is not, and ſo the others many immediately reſume it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again, becauſe the diſpoſition preceding in the nerves, heart and blood is not changed: which makes the ſoul feel her ſelf inſtigated almoſt in the ſame inſtant to deſire and not deſire the very ſame thing. From hence it was, that occaſion was taken to imagine two conteſting powers in her. Yet there may ſome kind of conteſtation be conceived herein, that oft times the ſame cauſe which excites ſome Paſſion in the ſoul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites alſo certain motions in the body whereunto the ſoul contributes not, and which ſhe ſtops or ſtrives to ſto aſſoon as ever ſhe perceives them: as is then tried, when that which excites fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe cauſeth alſo the Spirits to enter into the muſcles, that ſerve to ſtirre the legges to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Will to be bold, ſtops them.</p>

                  <p>IT will be commodious here to know that (as before hath been ſaid) although every motion of the kernell, ſeem to have been joyned by nature to each of our thoughts, even from the beginning of our life, they may yet he annexed to others by habit, as experience ſhews in words, that excite motions in the kernell, which according to the inſtitution of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent only to the ſoul their ſound, when they are pronounced by the Will, or by the figure of their letters when they are written, and which yet nevertheleſſe, by a habit acquired by thinking what they ſignifie, aſſoon as ever their ſound is heard, or their letters ſeen, uſe to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſignification rather then the form of our letters or the ſound of their ſillables. It is alſo convenient to know that although the motions, as well of the kernell as the ſpirits and braine, which repreſent certain objects to the Soul, be naturally joyned with thoſe that excite certain Paſſions in her, yet they may by habit be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and annexed to others very different; and moreover that this habit may be acquired by one action onely, and requires not a long uſuage: as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169809:38"/>as when a man at unawares meets with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty thing in a diſh of meat which he hath a very good ſtomack to, this accident may ſo alter the diſpoſition of the brain, thataman ſhall never afterwards ſee any ſuch kind of meat without loathing, whereas before he took delight in eating it. The very ſame thing may be ſeen in beaſts, for although they have no reaſon, nor it may be any thought, all the motions of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and the kernell, which excite Paſſions in us, yet are in them, and ſerve to foment and fortifie (not as in us the Paſſions, but) the motions of the nerves, andmuſcles their concomitants.

Now theſe things are profitable to know, to encourage every one to ſtudy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of his Paſſions. For ſince with a little art the motions of the brain in beaſts, who are void of reaſon, may be altered, it is evident they may more eaſily in men, and that even thoſe who have the weakeſt Souls, may acquire a moſt abſolute Empire over all their Paſſions, if art, and induſtry be uſed to mannage, and govern them.</p>

                  <p>NOr is it neceſſary to diſtinguiſh as many ſorts of Love, as there are diverſitie of objects which may be beloved. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, although the Paſſions of the ambitious man for glory, the avaritious for money, the drunkard for wine, the beſtiall for a woman he would violate, the man of honour for his friend, or miſtris, and a good father for his children, be in themſelves very different, yet, in that they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of Love, they are alike, but the foure firſt beare a Love meerely for the poſſeſſion of the objects where unto their Paſſion relates, and none at all to the objects themſelves for which they have onely a deſire, mingled with other particular Paſſions. Whereas the Love a good Father bears to his children is ſo pure, that he deſires to have nothing of them, and would not poſſeſſe them any otherwiſe than he does, nor be joyned neerer to them than he is already: but conſidering them as other Selfes, he ſeekes out their good as he would his owne, or rather with more care, becauſe, repreſenting to himſelf that he and they make but one whole, whereof he is not the better part, he oftentimes prefers their intereſts before his own, and fears not his ruine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169809:48"/>to ſave them. The affections which men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bear to their friends is of this very ſame nature, though it ſeldom be ſo perfect; and that they bear to their Miſtreſſe participates much of, but it hath alſo a ſmatch of the other.</p>

                  <p>ME thinkes Love may more juſtly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the eſteeme a man makes of what he Loves in compariſon of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For when he vallues the object of his Love leſſe then himſelf, he bears only a bare Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it: when he rates it equall with himſelf, it is called friendſhip; when more, that Paſſion may becalled Devotion. Thus a man may bear an Affection to a flow, a bird, a horſe, but unleſſe he have a brain greatly out of tune, he cannot have friendſhip but for men. And they are ſo far the object of this paſſion that there is no man ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, but one may bear a perfect friendſhip to him, if one but thinke ones ſelfe beloved by him, and that one have a Soul truly noble, and generous: as ſhall accordingly be explained in the hundred fifty fourth, and hundred fifty ſixt Article. As for Devotion, the principall object thereof is undoubledly the Soveraigne Divinity, whereunto a man cannot chuſe but be devout. If he but underſtand it as he ought to doe. But a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169809:49"/>man may carry a Devotion to his Prince too, to his Country, to his City, and even to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, when he eſteemes him much more than himſelfe. Now, the difference betwixt theſe three ſorts of Love, appears chiefly by their effects: for ſince in all of them a man conſiders himſelfe as joyned and united to the thing beloved, he is ever ready to abandon the leaſt part of all, which to conſerve the other, he attones therewith. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in bare Affection he alwayes prefers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before what he loves: &amp; contrariwiſe in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he ſo much prefers the thing before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he fears not to die for the conſervation of it. Whereof we have ſeen frequent examples, in thoſe who have expoſed themſelves to a certain death for the defence of their Prince, or their City, and ſometimes too, of particular Perſons to whom they have been devoted.</p>

                  <p>ANd I find only one conſiderable diſtinction, alike in each. It conſiſts in this, that the objects as well of Love, as Hatred, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Soul by the exteriour ſenſes, or elſe by the interiour, and ones own reaſon. For we commonly call that good or evil, which our interiour ſenſes our reaſon make us judge conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for, or contrary to our nature; but we call that handſome or ugly, which is ſo repreſented to us by our exteriour ſenſes, chiefly by the ſight, which alone is more conſidered then all the reſt. From whence ariſe two ſorts of Love; that which a man beares to good things, and that he bears to handſome things, whereunto we may give the name of Liking, that we may not confound it with the other, nor yet with Deſire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the name of Love is often attributed. And from hence ſpring, in the ſame manner, two ſorrs of Hatred, one whereof relates to things evil, the other to ugly: and this laſt, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake, may be called Horrour, or Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But the moſt obſervable thing herein, is that theſe Paſſions of liking, and Horrour are uſually more violent then the other kindes of Love, and Hatred, becauſe that which comes to the Soul by the ſenſes, touches her more to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169809:50"/>quicke, then what is repreſented by her reaſon; and yet moſt commonly they have leſſe truth. So that of all the Paſſions, theſe are the greateſt cheaters, whom a man ought moſt carefully to beware of.</p>

                  <p>I Know very well that in the Schools, that Paſſion which tends to the ſeeking after good, which onely is called Deſire, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that which tends to the avoiding of evil, which is called Averſion but Secing there is no good, the privation; whereof is not an evil, nor any evil taken in the notion of a poſitive thing, the privation whereof is not good: for example, that in ſeeking after riches, a man neceſſarily eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169809:50"/>poverty; in avoiding diſeaſes, he ſeekes after health; and ſo of the reſt. Me thinkes, it is ſtill the ſame motion which enclines to the ſeeking after good, and withall, to the avoyding evil, which is contrary to it, I onely obſerve this difference, that the deſire he hath, when he tends towards ſome good, is accompanied with Love, and afterwards with Hope, and Joy: whereas the ſame Deſire, when he tends to the avoyding an evil coutrary to this good, is attended with Hatred, Fear, and Sorrow: which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it is conceived contrary to it ſelf.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169809:53"/>from any function of the underſtanding, but only from the impreſſions which the motion of the ſpirits makes in the brains; and he feels himſelfe ſad likewiſe, when his body is indiſpoſed, although he know not that it is. Thus, the tickling of the ſenſes is ſo cloſely followed by Joy, and pain by ſadneſs, that moſt men cannot diſtinguiſh them, yet they differ ſo farre, that a man may ſomtimes ſuffer pains with Joy, and receive ticklings that diſpleaſe: but the cauſe why Joy commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows tickling is, becauſe all that is called tickling or a pleaſing touch, conſiſts in this, that the objects of the ſenſes excite ſome morions in the nerves, which would be apt to hurt them if they had not ſtrength enough to reſiſt it, or the body were not well diſpoſed; which makes an impreſſion in the brain, which being inſtituted by nature to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this good diſpoſition, and this ſtrength, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to the Soul as a good belonging to her, ſeeing ſhe is united to the Body, and ſo excites Joy in her, the cauſe is almoſt the ſame why a man naturally takes delight to feel himſelf mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to all ſorts of Paſſions, yea, even Sadneſs,\ and Hatred, when theſe Paſſions are cauſed only by ſtrange adventures, which he ſees perſonated on a ſtage, or by ſuch like occaſions, which not being capable to trouble us any way, ſeem to tickle the Soul by touching it.

                  <p>ANd I deduce the reaſon of all this, from what hath formerly been ſaid, that there is ſuch a tye betwixt our ſoul and body, that when we have joyned any corporall Action with any thought, one of them never preſents if ſelfe to us afterwards, without the other. As may be ſeen in ſuch, who with much averſneſſe, when they have been ſick, have taken ſome drink; they can neither eat nor drink afterwards but they have the ſame averſion: nay further, they cannot think of their a verſion to medecines, but the very ſame taſte comes into their thought. For, met thinks, the firſt paſſions our ſoul admitted when ſhe was firſt joyned to our Body, came from hence, that ſometimes the blood; or ſome other juyce which got into the heart, was an alimony more convenient than ordinary, to maintain heat there, which is the principle of life: this cauſed the Soul to joyne in will to this alimony, that is, to love it: and at the ſame time the ſpirits trickled from the braine into the muſcles, which might preſſe or agitate the parts, from whence it came to the heart, that they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169809:58"/>might ſend more of it thither: and theſe parts were the Stomack, and entrailes, whoſe agira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion augments the appetite, or elſe the liver, and lungs which the muſcles of the Diaphragma may preſſe. Wherefore the ſame motion of the ſpirits ever ſince accompanies the paſſion of Love.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SOmetimes, on the contrary, ſome ſtrange juyce came to the heart, which was not good to cheriſh the heat of it, or which elſe might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it: wherefore the ſpirits which aſcended from the heart to the braine, excited in the Soul the paſſion of Hatred. And at the ſame time alſo, theſe ſpirits went from the braine to the nerves which might drive the blood from the ſpleene, and the ſmall veines of the liver, to the heart to hinder this noxious juyce from getting in; and more, to thoſe which might repell this juyce to the intrailes, and the ſtomack, or elſe, ſometimes to make the Stomack diſgorge it. From whence it comes, that the ſame motions are uſed to accompany the Paſſion of Hatred. And in the liver one may diſcern by the eye, that there are inthe liver an abundance of veines, or pipes, indifferent broad, through which the juyce of meates may paſſe from the Port-veine into the hollow-veine, and from thence to the heart, without ſtopping any whit at the liver,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169809:59"/>but that there are alſo an infinite number of leſſer ones where it may ſtop, which alwayes contain a reſerve of blood, as the ſpleene doth too; which blood being thicker then that which is in the other parts of the Body, may better ſerve for nutriment to the fire in the heart, when the Stomck and entrailes lack wherewithall to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them.</p>

This hath excited in the Soul the Paſſion of Joy: and at the ſame time hath cauſed the Orifices of the heart to be more open then ordinary; and that the ſpirits trickling abundantly from the braine, not onely into the nerves which ſerve to open theſe Orifices, but alſo univerſally into all the reſt which drive the blood of the veines to the heart, hinder any from coming a freſh from the the liver, ſplcen, intrailes, and Stomack.

                  <p>THere is no Paſſion, but ſome particular geſture of the eyes declare it: and it is ſo palpable in ſome, that even the ſtupidſt ſerving-men by the eye of their maſter, obſerve whether he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, or not. But though a man may eaſily perceive theſe geſtures of the eyes, and know what they ſignifie, yet it is not an eaſie matter to deſcribe them, becauſe every one of them is compoſed of ſeverall alterations, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the motion, and figure of the eye, which are ſo peculiar, and ſo ſmall, that each of them cannot be diſcerned diſtinctly, though the reſult of their conjunction be eaſily marked. The ſame thing almoſt, may be ſaid of the geſtures of the face, which thus accompany the Paſſions: for though they be greater then thoſe of the eyes, yet it is difficult to diſtinguiſh them; &amp; they ſo little differ, that there are men almoſt of the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect when they weep as others when they laugh. It is true, there are ſome very remarkable; as the wrinkling of the forehead in wrath, and certain motions of the noſe, and lips in indignation, and deriſion: but they ſeem rather to be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then naturall. And generally, all the geſtures as well of the face as eyes, may be altered by the Soul, when being willing to conceal her
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169809:61"/>Paſſion, ſhe ſtrongly imagines one contrary to it: ſo that they may ſerve as well counterfeit, as declare Paſſions.</p>

                  <p>BUt it oft-times befalls, that a man does not wax pale when he is Sad, but contrarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes red; this ought to be atributed to other Paſſions joyned to ſadneſs, to wit, Love, Deſire, and ſometimes, even Hatred too; for theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, heating, or agitating the blood which comes from the liver, entrailes, and the reſt of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts, drive it to the heart, and from thence through the great Artery to the veines of the face, the Sadneſs which obſtructs the Orifices of the heart on each ſide not being able to hinder it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it is mighty exceſſive; but when it is only moderate, it eaſily hinders the blood ſo come into the veines of the face from deſcending into the heart, while Love, Deſire, or Hatred drive other thither from the interiour parts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this blood being ſetled about the face, makes it look red; and indeed, redder then in Joy, becauſe the colour of the blood appears ſo much the better, as it flowes quicker, and alſo becauſe more blood can then get up into the veins of the face, then when the Orifices of the heart are more open; This is more palpable in ſhame, which is compounded of ſelf-Love, and an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Deſire to ſhunne preſent infamy: which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169809:62"/>cauſeth the blood to come from the interiour parts to the heart; from thence through the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the face: and withall, of a moderate Sadneſs, which hinders this blood from returning to the heart. The ſame is alſo ſeen ordinarily when a man weeps: for, as I ſhall ſay hereafter, it is Love joyned to Sadneſs, which, for the moſt part cauſes tears; it appears alſo in Anger, or oft-times an eager Deſire of Revenge mixed with Love, Hatred, and Sadneſs.</p>

                  <p>TRemblings have two ſeverall cauſes: one is, that there come ſometimes too few ſpirits from the brain into the nerves; the other, that there come ſometimes too many, ſo that the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paſſages of the muſcles cannot be duly ſhut, which as hath been ſaid in the eleventh Article, ought to be ſhut to determine the motion of the members; the chiefe cauſe of it appears to be in Sadneſs, and fearfulneſs; as alſo when a man ſhakes with cold; for theſe Paſſions, as well as the cold of the aire, may ſo thicken the blood, that it may not furniſh the brain with ſpirits enough, to ſend any into the nerves; the other cauſe appears often in thoſe who ardently deſire any thing, and in thoſe who are moved with wrath, as alſo in thoſe who are drunk, for theſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169809:63"/>two Paſſions, as well as Wine, ſometimes make ſo many ſpirits go into the brain, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regularly be conveyed from thence into the muſcles.</p>

                  <p>LAnguiſhing is a diſpoſition to eaſe ones ſelfe, and be without motion, which is felt in all the members: it comes, as trembling, becauſe there are not ſpirits enough in the nerves; but in a different manner; for the cauſe of trembling is, that there are not enough in the brain, to obey the determinations of the kernell, when that drives them to any muſcle: whereas Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeds from hence, that the kernell doth not determine them to goe to ſome muſcles, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then others.</p>

                  <p>ANd the Paſſion which moſt commonly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this effect is Love; joyned to the Deſire of a thing the acquiſition whereof is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned poſſible for the preſent time for love ſo buſies the Soul in conſidering the object beloved, that it employes all the ſpirits which are in the brain to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169809:63"/>repreſent the image of it to her, and ſtops all the motions of the kernell not ſubſervient to this purpoſe. And it is to be noted concerning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the property which I ahve attributed to it, of rendring the body more active, agrees not to it, but when a man imagines the object deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſuch, that he may from that very time doe ſomething which may ſerve to acquire it. For if, on the other ſide, he imagines it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him at that time to doe any thing that may conduce thereunto, all the agitation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire remaines in the brain not at all paſſing into the nerves; and being wholly employed in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Idea of the object deſired there, leaves the reſt of the body languiſhing.</p>

Now, there are divers indiſpoſitions of the body, which may make a man fall to fainting, thus: but among the Paſſions, none but extream joy is obſerved to have this power; and the manner, whereby, I ſuppoſe it works its effect is thus: opening ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily the Orifices of the heart, the blood of the veines doth ſo huddle in, and in ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant a quantity, that it cannot there be rarified by the heat ſoon enough to lift up the little skins, that ſhut the entries of thoſe veines; by which means it ſmothers the fire, which it uſed to feed, when it came into the heart in fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>

                  <p>ANd I can mark but two cauſes, which blow up the lungs thus ſuddenly; the firſt is a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal of Admiration, which being joyned to Joy may ſo quickly open the Orifices of the heart, that a great abundance of blood, getting in all together at the right ſide of it through the hollow
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169809:65"/>veine, is rarified there, and paſſing from thence through the arterious veine, blows up the lungs; the other is the mixture of ſome liquour, that augments the rarefaction of the blood; and I find none fit for that purpoſe but the wheyeſt part of that which comes from the Spleen, which part of the blood being driven to the heart, by ſome light emotion of Hatred, aſſiſted by a ſurprize of Admiration, and mixing there with the blood which comes from the other parts of the body, which Joy cauſes to enter in thither abundantly, may cauſe this blood to dilate much more then uſual; as we ſee many hquours ſwell up over the fire, if one fling but a little vinegar into the veſſel where they are; for the wheyeſt part of the blood which comes from the ſpleene; is of a nature like vinegar. Experience alſo ſhews us, that in all ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters producing this lowd Laughter which-comes from the lungs, there is ſtill ſome little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Hatred, or at leaſt of Admiration, and thoſe whoſe ſpleens are not ſound, are ſubject not only to be more ſad, but by intervalls more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and diſpoſed to laughter then others; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſpleene ſends two ſorts of blood to the heart, one, thick and groſſe, which cauſeth Sadneſſe, the other, exceeding fluid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, which cauſeth Joy. And oft-times, after much Laughter a man feeles himſelfe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclined to ſadneſſe, becauſe the moſt fluid part of the blood of the ſpleene being exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the groſſer followes it to the heart.</p>

                  <p>FOr that kinde of Laughter which ſometimes accompanies, Indignation, it is uſually arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and ſeigned. But when it is naturall, it ſeemes to come from the Joy a man hath, to ſee he cannot be hurt by the evil whereat he is offended, and withall that he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſurprized by the novelty, or the unexpected encounter of this evil. So that Joy, Hatred, and Admiration contribute to it. Yet I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it may be produced without any Joy, by the meer motion of Adverſion, which ſends the blood from the ſpleen to the heart, where it is rarified, and thruſt from thence into the lungs, which it eaſily blowes up when it findes them empty. And generally, whatſoever ſuddenly blowes up the lungs in this manner, cauſeth the exteriour Action of Laughter: except when Sadneſſe alters it into groanes, and ſhrickes, that accompany tears. <hi>Vives</hi> 3 <hi>de Anima, cap: de Riſu.</hi> Writes of himſelfe (which is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this) that when he had been a long time faſting, the firſt bits he put in his mouth made him laugh: which might come from hence; his lungs empty of blood for want of nutriment, was ſuddenly blowne up by the firſt juyce that paſſed from his Stomack to his heart:

                  <p>NOw as I have written in the Meteors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining after what manner the vapours of the aire convert into rain, that is proceeds from their being leſſe agitated, or more abundant than ordinary: ſo, I beleeve, that when thoſe that iſſue from the Body are farre leſſe agitated then uſually, although they are not ſo abundant, yet they may convert to water: which cauſeth the cold ſweats, that ſometimes proceed of weakneſſe, when a man is ſick. And I beleeve that when they are more abundant, provided they be not withall more agitated, they alſo convert into water, this cauſeth ſweat when one uſeth exerciſe.

So, there needs only a ſtraw in the eye, to draw out ſome teares: by reaſon that exciting paine in it, it altars the diſpoſition of the pores; ſo that ſome becoming more narrow, the ſmall parts of the vapours paſſe leſſe quickly through it; and whereas formerly they iſſued out equally diſtant the one from the other, and ſo were ſeparated, They come to meet becauſe the order of theſe pores is moleſted, by which meanes they joyn together, and ſo convertinto teares.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169809:70"/>ſome ſuch like objects, or elſe had a fellow-feeling of their mothers reſentment, who was ſo diſtaſted when ſhe was with child; for it is ceertain, there is an affinity between the motions of the mother, and the child in her womb, ſo that whatſoever is diſpleaſing to one, offends the other; and the ſmell of Roſes may have cauſed ſome great head-ach in the child, when it was in the cradle; or a Cat may have affrighted it, and none took notice of it, nor the Child ſo much as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it; though the Idea of that Averſion he then had to Roſes, or a Cat, remain imprinted in his brain to his lives end.</p>

                  <p>BUt becauſe theſe Paſſions cannot ſway us to any actions, but by the interpoſition of the Deſire that they excite, it is Deſire which wee ought peculiarly to regulate, and therein conſiſts the principall part of Morality. Now, as I ſaid juſt now, it is alwayes good when it follows a true knowledge, ſo it cannot chuſe but be bad when it is grounded on an errour; and me thinks, the moſt ordinary errour committed in Deſire, is when a man doth not clearly enough diſtinguiſh the things which abſolutely depend on our ſelves, from thoſe which doe not. For, concerning thoſe which depend of us, that is of our free diſpoſition, it is enough to know that they are good, not to deſire them with too much vehemence; becauſe it is a following of vertue, to doe the good things that depend of us; and it is certain, he cannot have too ardent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Vertue. Beſides, what we thus deſire cannot chuſe but be accompliſhed; ſince it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending only on us, we ever receive the plenary ſatisfaction wee expect; but the uſuall fault herein is, not that we deſire too much, but too little, and the ſoveraigne remedy againſt that is, as much as in us lies, to ridde the ſpirit of all kind

                  <p>FOr thoſe things which depend not any wayes of us, how good ſoever they be, they ought never to be deſired with Paſſion: not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not befall, and by this means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us ſo much the more, by how much more they were deſired: but chiefly, becauſe when they poſſeſſe our thoughts, they divert us from bending our affection to other things, the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whereof depends of our ſelves; and there are two generall remedies againſt theſe idle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; the firſt generoſity, which I will ſpeak of hereafter; the ſecond is, that we ought to reflect on divine Providence, and imagine to our ſelves that it is impoſſible that any thing happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then this Providence hath determined from all eternity ſo that there is a kind of fatality, or unreſiſtable neceſſity to oppoſe Fortune to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her, as a Chimera proceeding only from the errour of our underſtandings, for wee can deſire nothing but what we think in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poſſible; and wee cannot ſuppoſe things which depend not of as poſſible, ſeeing we think
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169809:74"/>they depend not on Fortune: that is wee ſuppoſe, they may happen, and the like hath happened formerly. Now, this opinion is only grounded upon this, that wee not underſTanding, all the cauſes, contributary to every effect; for when a thing which we ſuppoſed to depend on Forume doth not fall out, that ſhewes ſome of the cauſes neceſſary to produce was wanting: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it was abſolutely impoſſible and that the like did never happen, that is, where a like cauſe of its Production was wanting: ſo that had wee not been ignorant of that before, we ſhould never have imagined them poſſible, nor conſequently ſhould ever have deſired them.</p>

                  <p>THis vulgar opinion then, that there is without us a Fortune which cauſeth things to fall out, or not to fall out, according to her pleaſure, muſt be utterly rejected; and it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that all things are guided by a divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, whoſe eternall decree is ſo infallible and immutable, that unleſs thoſe things which the ſame decree hath pleaſed to let depend on our free diſpoſition, we ought to think, for our parts, that nothing happens but what of neceſſity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169809:75"/>muſt, as if it were fatall, ſo that without a crime, we cannot deſire it may happen otherwiſe. But becauſe the moſt part of our Deſires extend to two things which depend not altogether on our ſelves, nor altogether elſe-where, we ought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to diſtinguiſh, what in them depends on our ſelves, that we may not let our Deſire ramble any farther then that; and for what is over and above, though we ſhould eſteem the ſucceſſe thereof abſolutely fatall, and immutable, that our Deſire buſie not it ſelfe thereabout, we ſhould not omit to conſider the reaſons why it ought leſſe or more to be hoped for, that they may ſerve to regulate our actions. For if for example, wee had any buſineſſe at a place whither wee might goe two ſeverall wayes, one whereof uſes to be much ſafer than the other, although the decree of Providence may be ſuch, that if we go that way which is conceived ſafeſt, wee ſhall not eſcape robbing; and on the contrary, we might have gone the other way without any danger, yet we ought not therefore to be indifferent which we take, nor reſt upon the immutable fatality of this decree; But reaſon wills us to chooſe the way which uſed to be ſafeſt: and our Deſire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ought to be fulfilled, whatſoever evill befall us by following it: becauſe this evill (or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe) having been, as to us, inevitable we have no occaſion to wiſh to be exempted from it, but only doe the beſt our underſtanding can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as, I ſuppoſe, we have done; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169809:75"/>that when a man exerciſeth himſelfe ſo, to diſtinguiſh betwixt Fatallity, and Fortune, he eaſily habituates himſelfe ſo to regulate his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that ſeeing the fulfilling of them depends onely on our ſelves, they may alwayes give us an abſolute ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>I Will onely adde here one conſideration, which me thinks is very uſefull, to hinder us from receiving any diſcommodity by our Paſſions; it is, that our good, and will depends chiefly of interiour emotions, excited in the Soul onely by the Soul her ſelf: wherein they differ from theſe Paſſions, which ever depend of ſome motion of the ſpirits. And although theſe emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul be often joyned to the Paſſions reſembling them, they may alſo be often found among other Paſſions, and even ſpring from thoſe that are contrary to them. For example, when a husband weeps for his deceaſed wife, whom (as oft it falls out) it would vex him to ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life againe: it may be, his heart is ſtraightned by Sadneſſe, which the ſolemnity of the funerall and the abſence of a perſon, whoſe converſation he was uſed to, excite in him; and, it may be, ſome remnants of Love, or Pity, which preſent themſelves to his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169809:76"/>draw true tears from his eyes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in the mean time he feels a ſecret Joy in the moſt interiour part of his Soul; whoſe emotion is ſo ſtrong that the Sadneſſe, and tears accompanying it, cannot diminiſh any of its force. And when we read ſtrange adventures in a book, or ſee them perſonated on a ſtage, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excites Sadneſſe in us, ſometimes Joy, or Love, or Hatred, and generally all the Paſſions, according to the diverſity of objects, that offer themſelves to our imagination; but withall we take a delight, to feel them excited in us, and this delight is an intellectuall Joy, which may as well ſpring from Sadneſſe, as all the reſt of the Paſſions.</p>

For though they commonly ſignifie onely the opinions a man hath without any Paſſion, of the vallue of any thing, yet becauſe from theſe opinions doe often ſpring Paſſions which want peculiar names, me thinkes, theſe may be attributed to them. And Eſtimation, as it is a Paſſion, is an inclination of the Soul, to repreſent unto her ſelfe the vallue of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169809:78"/>thing eſteemed, which inclination is cauſed by a peculiar motion of the ſpirits, ſo conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the braine, that they there fortifie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions belonging to that purpoſe.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169809:79"/>may juſtly be praiſed or blamed: and it makes us in ſome manner like unto God, by making us maſters of our ſelves, provided wee doe not loſe, the priviledges it gives us, by our unworthineſs.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169809:81"/>cannot refraine from doing things, whereof he knowes not whether he ſhall repent or no after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: then beſides, that he beleeves he cannot ſubſiſt of himſelfe, nor forgoe many things, whoſe acquiſition depends from without him. So it is directly oppoſite to Generoſity, and it oft befalls that men of a meane ſpirit, are moſt anogant and proud, juſt as the moſt generous are moſt modeſt, and humble. But whereas thoſe of a generous ſpirit alter not their nature by any proſperity or adverſity that befalls them, thoſe who are weake, and abject are onely guided by fortune and proſperity doth not puffe up ſo high, but adverſity brings them down as low.

                  <p>MOreover, it is eaſie to underſtand that Pride, and dejection are not onely vices but Paſſions, becauſe their emotion is very palpable exteriourly in thoſe who are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly puffed up or brought down by any new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. But it may be doubted whether Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169809:82"/>and Humility, which are vortues may alſo be Paſſions, becauſe their motions appeare leſſe, and it ſeemes, vertue doth not ſo much Symbolize with Paſſion, as vice doth. Yet I ſee no neaſon why the ſame motion of the ſpirits, which ſerves to fortifie a thought when it hath an ill ground, ſhould not alſo fortifie it, when it hath a juſt one. And becauſe Pride, and Generoſitie, conſiſt onely in the good opinion a man hath of himſelfe, and differ onely herein; that the opinion in one is unjuſt, in the other juſt me thinkes they may be attributed to one and the ſame Paſſion, which is excited by a motion compounded of Admiration, Joy, and Love, as well that a man beares to himſelfe, as to the thing for which he doth eſteeme himſelfe. As on the contrary, the motion that excites Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whether vertuous or vitious, is compoſed of Admiration, Sadneſſe, and ſelf Love, mixed with Hatred of thoſe defects which cauſe one to be contemned. And all the difference that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in theſe motions, is, that that of Admiration hath two properties the firſt, that the ſurprize makes it ſtrong from the very beginning: the other, that it is equall in its continuance. That is, the ſpirits continue moving at the ſame rate in the braine. Of which properties, the firſt is found oftner in Pride, and Dejection then in Generoſitie or vertuous Humility; and on the other ſide the laſt is more obſerved in theſe than in the others. The reaſon whereof is, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169809:82"/>vice proceeds commonly from ignorance, ſo that they who leaſt underſtand themſelves are apteſt to grow more proud, or become more abject than they ought to bee, becauſe every new thing that befalls them ſurprizeth them, and cauſeth them, that attributing it to themſelves, they admire and eſteeme or contemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they judge that which is befallen them advantagious to them, or not. But becauſe as ſoon as one thing hath elated them, comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that dejects them the motion of their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is various. Contrarily, there is nothing in Generoſitie, incompatible with vertuous Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor any thing extraneous that can alter it: wherefore the motions thereof are firme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and ever like themſelves. But they proceed not ſo much from ſurprizall, becauſe they who in this manner eſteem themſelves, do very well underſtand the reaſons why they ſo eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Yet it may be ſaid that theſe cauſes are ſo wonderfull (to wit, the power of their free Diſpoſition, which makes them prize them-themſelves and the infirmities of the ſubject in which this power is, which makes them not to vallue themſelves too high) that as often as they are preſented new, they ſtill cauſe new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>

                  <p>ANd it is to be noted, that what commonly are called vertues, are habits in the Soul which diſpoſe it to certain thoughts, ſo that they are different from theſe thoughts, but they may produce them, and reciprocally be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them. It is alſo to be noted, that theſe thoughts may be produced onely by the Soul, but it oft befalls that ſome motion of the ſpirits fortifies them, and then they are at the ſame time actions of vertue, and Paſſions of the Soul. So though there be no vertue whereunto (me thinks) good birth ſo much contributes, as that which cauſeth a man to eſteem himſelfe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his juſt value; and it be eaſie to believe, that all Souls which God puts into our bodies, are not equally noble and ſtrong (wherefore I called this vertue Generoſitie, according to the acception of our language, rather than Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, the School tearms that it may be the more unknown) yet it is certain that good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much conduces to correct the defects of our birth; and that if a man buſy himſelfe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider what this free Diſpoſition is, and how great advantages accrue from a ſtedfaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to uſe it well; as on the other ſide, how vain and unprofitable all the cares that puzzle
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169809:83"/>the ambitious are; a man may by exciting the Paſſion in himſelfe, acquire the vertue of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, which being as the key of all the other vertues, and a generall remedy againſt all the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities of Paſſions, me thinkes, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ought to be very ſeriouſly noted.</p>

For we bear Love, and Devotion rather than a meer Veneration to thoſe from whom we onely expect good, and we bear Hatred to none but ſuch as we only expect evill from; and if we conceive the cauſe of this good, or evil not to be free, we do not ſubmit ourſelves thereunto to get the goodwill of it. So when the Pagans bore a Veneration to woods, ſprings, mountains, they did not properly reverence theſe inanimate things, but the Divinities which they thought preſided over them.

                  <p>COurage, when it is a Paſſion, and not a habit or naturall, inclination, is a certain heat or agitation which diſpoſeth the Soul to addict her powerfully to the execution of the things ſhe will doe, of what nature ſoever they be; and Boldneſſe is a ſort of Courage that diſpoſeth the Soul to the execution of things moſt dangerous.</p>

                  <p>AND Emulation alſo is a ſort of it, but in another ſenſe; for Courage may be conſidered as a kind (or Genus) that is divided into as many ſorts (or Species) as there are ſeverall objects, and as many more as it hath cauſes. In the firſt ſence Boldneſſe is a ſort, in the other Emulation; and this laſt is nothing elſe but a heat, which diſpoſeth the Soul to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take things that ſhe hopes may ſucceed with her, becauſe ſhee ſees them ſucceed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and ſo it is a ſort of Courage, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſe is example. I ſay, the externall cauſe, becauſe it ought ever (beſides that) to have an internall one which conſiſts in this, that the body is ſo diſpoſed, as Deſire, and Hope are ſtronger to drive abundance of blood to the heart, than Fear or Deſpaire to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>

                  <p>FOr it is to be noted, that although the object of Boldneſſe be difficulty, from whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enſues Fear, or even Deſpaire, ſo that it is in moſt dangerous and deſperate affairs that moſt Boldneſſe and Courage is required; nevertheleſſe there muſt be ſome Hope, or elſe a man muſt be aſſured that the end he propounds to himſelfe ſhall ſucceed, to oppoſe himſelfe vigorouſly againſt the difficulties he ſhall encounter. But this end is different from this object. For he can not be aſſured, and deſpairing of the ſame thing at the ſame time. So when the <hi>Decij</hi> flung them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt of their enemies, and ran up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certain death, the object of their Boldneſſe was the difficulty of keeping their lives in this action, of which difficulty they utterly deſpaired, for they were ſure to die, but their end was to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their ſouldiers by their example, and make them winne the victory, of which they had Hope; or elſe, their end was to get Fame after their death, whereof they were aſſured.</p>

But I here uſe this word, to ſignifie a Paſſion which is not alwayes vicious. Envy then, as it is a Paſſion, is a ſort of Sadneſſe mixed with Hatred which comes from ſeeing good betide thoſe we thinke unworthy of it. Which cannot be thought with reaſon, but of the goods of fortune. For, as for thoſe of the Soul, yea and the Body too, ſeeing a man hath them by birth; it is to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently worthy of them, that he received them from God before he was capable to commit any evill.</p>

                  <p>BUt when fortune ſends goods to any one, whereof he is truly unworthy, and Envy is not excited in us but becauſe naturally loving juſtice, we are vext that it is not obſerved in the diſtribution of thoſe goods, it is a zeal that may be excuſable; eſpecially when the good a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169809:91"/>man envyes others, is of ſuch a nature that it may turn to an evill in their hands, as if it be ſome command or office, in the exerciſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may miſdemean themſelves. Yea, even when he deſires that good for himſelfe, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get it, becauſe others leſſe worthy poſſeſſe It. This makes this paſſion become the more violent: and yet it may be excuſible, provided the Hatred in it relate only to the ill diſtribution of the thing envied, and not to the perſons that poſſeſſe, or diſtribute it. But there are few who are ſo juſt and generous as to bear no Hatred againſt thoſe that prevent them, in the acquiſition of a good that is not communicable to many, and that they deſired it for themſelves, though they who acquired it are as much or more worthy of it. And what is moſt uſually envied is Glory. For although that of others doth not hinder us from aſpiring thereunto, yet it makes the acceſſe to it more difficult, and enhaunceth the price.</p>

Whence, Envy is called in Latine <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor;</hi> which agrees very well with what hath been ſaid here before of the motions of the blood in Sadneſſe, and hatred; for this cauſeth the syellow choler comming from the lower part of the Liver, and the black comming from the Spleen, to ſpread from the heart through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into all the veines: and that cauſeth the blood of the veines to have leſſe heat, and flow more ſlowly than ordinarily, which is ſufficient to make the complexion livid.

                  <p>FOr Ingratitude, it is not a Paſſion: for nature never put any motion of the ſpirits in us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it: but it is onely a vice directly oppoſite to Gratitude, ſeeing this is ever vertuous, and one of the principall bonds of humane ſociety. s Wherefore this vice appertaines to none but belluine men, and the fooliſhly arrogant, who thinke all things their due; or the ſottiſh, who reflect not on the good deeds they receive; or elſe the weak, and abject, who feeling their own infirmitie and neceſſity, baſely ſeek aſſiſtance
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169809:95"/>from others, and after they have received it hate them: becauſe having no Will to return the like, or deſpairing ever to doe it, and imagining the whole world as mercenary as themſelves, and that none doe good but with Hope of being rewarded for it, they think they have deſired it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>INdignation is a ſort of Hatred or Averſion, that a man naturally beares to thoſe who doe ſome evil, of what nature ſoever it be. And it is often mixed with Envy, or Pity, but yet, the object thereof is altogether different from them. For he carryes an Indignation onely againſt thoſe who doe good or evil to perſons unworthy of it: but he envies thoſe who receive this good, and pities thoſe who receive this evil. It is true, in ſome reſpects it is evil to poſſeſſe a good whereof a man is not worthy. Which may be the reaſon wherefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers, ſuppoſing that Envy is alwayes a vice, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Indignation which is not vicious.</p>

                  <p>TO doe an evill, is alſo in ſome reſpects to receive one, from whence it comes that ſome with their Indignation joyn Pity, and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion: according as they bear a good or ill Will towards thoſe whom they ſee commit faults.

                  <p>INdignation is alſo oftimes accompanied with Admiration. For we uſe to think that all things ſhall be done in the ſame manner we conceive they ought to be done, that is, after that manner which we eſteem good. Wherefore when it falls out otherwiſe it ſurprizeth us, and we Admire it. Nor is it incompatible with Joy, although it moſt commonly be joyned with Sadneſſe. For when the evill we bear an Indignation againſt cannot hurt us, and we conſider that we would not doe the like, it gives us ſome delight: and

                  <p>FUrthermore, Indignation is obſerved to be more in thoſe who would ſeem vertuous, than thoſe who really are. For althought they who love vertue cannot without ſome Averſion look upon the vices of others, they are Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate onely againſt the great and extraordinary ones. For it is to be nice, and ſquamiſh, to have much Indignation for things of little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is to be unjuſt to have any for thoſe which are not blamworthy; and it is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and abſurd not to confine this Paſſion to the Actions of men, but extend them to the works of God or nature: as they do who being snever contented with their condition or fortune, dare controule the government of the world, and the ſecrets of providence.</p>

                  <p>WRath is alſo a ſort of Hatred or Averſion againſt thoſe that have done any evill, or endeavoured to hurt, not indifferently any thing whatſoever, but particularly our ſelves. So it containes all Indignation doth, and this beſides, that it is grounded upon an action that we are Senſible of, and whereof we have a Deſire to be revenged. For this Deſire almoſt ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, and is directly oppoſite to Gratitude as Indignation is to Good-will. But it is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compare, more violent than theſe other three Paſſions, becauſe the deſire to repell things hurtfull, and be revenged, is moſt vehement of all. It is this deſire, joyned to ſelfe-love, that furniſheth Wrath with all the agitation of blood that Courage and Boldneſſe can cauſe: and Hatred eſpecially cauſeth the colericke blood, that comes from the ſpleen, and the little veines of the liver, which receives this agitation, and gets into the heart: or becauſe of its abundance, and the nature of the choler wherewith it is mingled, it excites a ſharper and more ardent heat, than can be excited therein either by Love, or Joy.</p>

                  <p>ANd the exteriour ſignes of this Paſſion are different, according to the ſeverall tempers of men, and the variety of other Paſſions that make it up or joyne with it. So ſome are ſeen to wax pale, or tremble, when they are in Wrath: others bluſh or weep. And it is uſually thought that the Wrath of thoſe who wax pale is more to be feared, than of thoſe who bluſh. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof is, that when a man will not, or cannot revenge himſelfe with ought but lookes or words, he ſets all his heat and ſtrength on work at the very firſt, when he is moved: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſometimes ſorrow, and ſelfe Pity hat he cannot revenge himſelfe any other way, occaſions weeping. And on the contrary they who reſerve themſelves, and determine on a greater revenge become ſad in regard they thinke they ought to be ſo for the Action that incenſeth them: and they ſometimes alſo fear the evils that enſue the reſolution they have taken; which makes them inſtantly become pale, cold, and trembling. But afterwards when they come to execute their revenge, they are ſo much the more heated, as they were at firſt cooled: as we ſee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169809:97"/>agues that begin with cold fits, are uſually the violenteſt.</p>

                  <p>THis informes us that two ſorts of Wrath may be diſtinguiſhed; one ſudden, and exteriour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt, but yet of ſmall efficacy, and eaſily appeaſed; the other not ſo apparent at firſt, but that gnawes more on the heart, and hath more dangerous effects. Thoſe who have much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Love are the moſt ſubject to the firſt; for it proceeds not from any deep Hatred, but from a ſudden Averſion, that ſurpriſeth them, becauſe being addicted to imagine that all things ought to be carried the way they conceive to bee beſt, as ſoon as any thing falls out otherwiſe they admire it, and are angry at it, oftentimes too, when the thing concerns not them in particular, becauſe being full of affection, they intereſt themſelves in the behalfe of thoſe they love, as if it were for themſelves; ſo what would only bee an occaſion of indignation to another, is to them of Wrath; and becauſe their inclination to Love makes them alwayes have a great deal of heat and blood in the heart, the Averſion that ſurpriſeth them that drives never ſo little choler
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169809:98"/>thither, cauſeth immediatly a great emotion in this blood but this emotion is not laſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtrength of the ſurprize continues not, and as ſoon as they perceive that the occaſion that incenceth them ought not to have moved them ſo, they repent thereof.</p>

But as nothing makes it more exceſſive than Pride ſo, I believe, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is the beſt remedy againſt the exceſſes of it: becauſe making a man eſteem but very little all ſuch goods as may be taken away, and on the other ſide highly value the liberty and abſolute empire over himſelfe, which he ceaſes to have when any thing can offend him, it makes him only beſtow Contempt, or at the moſt Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the injuries others uſe to bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169809:100"/>comes from often receiving great affronts; for there is none when he is young, but imagines that Praiſe is a good, and Infamy an evill, much more important to life than experience finds they are; when having received ſome eminent affronts, a man ſees himſelfe utterly degraded of honour, and contemned by every one; wherefore they become impudent, and meaſuring good and evill only by the conveniences of the body, they ſee that they enjoy them afterwards as well, Yea, and ſometimes better, becauſe they are eaſed of many hardſhips, whereunto Honour obliged them: and if the loſſe of their eſtate be joyned to their diſgrace, yet there are charitable people who will give them ſome.</p>

                  <p>ANd now we know them all, we have leſſe reaſon to fear them, than we had before. For we ſee that naturally they are all good, and that we ought to avoid onely the ill uſe of them, or their exceſſes: for which the remedies I have laid down may ſuffice, if every man were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough to practiſe them. But becauſe I have put Premeditation and Induſtry among theſe remedies, whereby the defects of nature may be corrected, by uſing to ſeparate the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the blood &amp; ſpirits in ones ſelf, from the thoughts wherewith they uſe to be joyned. I confeſſe, few men are thus prepared againſt all encounters: and that theſe motions excited in the blood, by the objects of Paſſions, doe ſo immediately follow the meere impreſſions in the brain, and the diſpoſition of the organs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Soul be no way contributary, that no humane wiſdome is able to reſiſt them, when one is not enough prepared ſo, many cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from laughing when they were tickled, though they take no delight in it; for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſurprize of Joy that hath made them laugh formerly on the ſame occaſion, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened in their fancy, makes their lungs be blown up on a ſudden whether they will or no,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169809:101"/>by the blood that the heart ſends thither. So they who are much addicted by nature to the emotions of Joy, or Pitty, or Chearfulneſſe, or Wrath, cannot refrain from ſwouning, weeping, trembling, or having the blood ſtirred as if they had a Fever, when their fancy is throughly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by an object of any of theſe Paſſions. But what may be done on ſuch an occaſion, and what I think to lay down here as the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall remedy, and the eaſieſt to he practiſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all exorbitances of the Paſſions is, that when a man perceives his blood thus moved, he ought to be wary and remember that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is preſented to our Imagination, tends to the deluſion of the Soul, and makes reaſons that ſerve to perſwade the object of Paſſions appear farre ſtronger than they are, and thoſe which ſerve to diſſwade, farre weaker. And when Paſſion perſwades things, the execution whereof admits of ſome delay, he muſt abſtain from giving his judgement thereon immediatly, and divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from it to other thoughts, untill time, and reſt, have wholly allayed the emotion in the blood. And laſtly, when it incites to actions, concerning which reſolutions are inſtantly to be taken, the Will muſt peculiarly dedicate it ſelfe to conſider and follow the reaſons repugnant to thoſe which the Paſſion repreſents, although they appear leſs weighty; as when a man is ſuddenly aſſaulted by an enemy, occaſion doth not give him leave to waſte any time in debate: but what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169809:102"/>it ſeems, thoſe who are accuſtomed to make a reflexion on their own actions, may do; that is, when they feel themſelves ſtruck with an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright; they will endeavour to divert their thoughts from the conſideration of the danger, by repreſenting to themſelves the reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is more ſafety and honour in reſiſtance than flight; and on the contrary, when they feel the Deſire of revenge and Wrath incite them, to ruſh inconſideratly on thoſe who beſet them, they ſhould call to mind, that it is indiſcretion to deſtroy themſelves, when they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without diſhonour; and if there bee too much odds, it is better to make a handſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or take quarter, than ſavagely to expoſe themſelves to a certain death.</p>
